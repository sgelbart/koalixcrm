.. note::
    This version is not recommended for production use. Therefore production installation is not yet mentioned in this documentation.

By platform
-----------

Pango, GdkPixbuf, and cairo can not be installed
with pip and need to be installed from your platform’s packages.
lxml and CFFI can, but you’d still need their own dependencies.
This section lists system packages for lxml or CFFI when available,
the dependencies otherwise.
lxml needs *libxml2* and *libxslt*, CFFI needs *libffi*.
On Debian, the package names with development files are
``libxml2-dev``, ``libxslt1-dev`` and ``libffi-dev``.
